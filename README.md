# MachineLearning-Projects
Supervised learning:-analyzes historical data to predict new outcomes. For example, predicting property prices.
Unsupervised learning:- looks for data patterns by using statistical analysis. For example, identifying customer segments within your company sales data.

# Project Description
(Iam doing all Machine Learning projects with diffrent Algorithms.Major Facing Problems Of ML -> The Talent Gap. One major machine learning challenge is finding people with the technical ability to understand and implement it.
Expensive Computational Needs.
Black Box Answers.
Data Hungry.
TThese Are Solvable Problems.)

# Needs of this projects 
data exploration/descriptive statistics,
data processing/cleaning,
statistical modeling,
writeup/reporting,
etc.
