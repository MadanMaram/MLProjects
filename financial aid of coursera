#### Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
I'm a student from India and I'm interested in this course as it offers educational opportunities and is ideal for the career path I've chosen. So, I'm writing to apply for Financial Aid. Currently, I've had no job or source of income of my own to pay for the expense of this course for certification. I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree through scholarships and bank loans. Along with me in our family I've one sister who is also studying so, it is very difficult for our father to pay for the expenses of us and I don't want to add one more headache to him by applying for this course so, I'm requesting Coursera to consider my application and grant me financial aid to complete this course. I promise to utilize this golden opportunity and work hard to learn more and more.

#### How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? (150 words minimum required)
SQL is being a field in high demand, I want to complete the SQL Course by University of California, Davis. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out SQL and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. As written above, Coursera has been not only suggested by my student peers but also our college faculty, and so following their prestigious advice, I would be glad to gain more knowledge and sharpen my skills with this course. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I think will supplement my learning. I also plan to grade assignments which are peer-reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity

#### If you answered no, please help us understand why.
As I have answered before, having no permanent source of income, I really don't see any way of advancing and paying for my course. the financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank, and my parents are paying it regularly. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them.  I don't want to put any pressure on them.
